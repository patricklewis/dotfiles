[Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)-based dotfile management, inspired by [Brandon Invergo](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

## Usage

1. Install stow
2. Clone repository into ~/.dotfiles
3. cd into the cloned directory and `stow vim`, `stow tmux`, etc.
